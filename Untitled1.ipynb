      "“See,” “look” and “watch” are often confused in meaning. However, they should be used in different situations. The difference between the three verbs can be explained in the following way:\n",

      "Look — to look at something directly.\n",
      "See — to see something that comes into our sight that we weren’t looking for.\n",
      "Watch — to look at something carefully, usually at something that’s moving.\n",
